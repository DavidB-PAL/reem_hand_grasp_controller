Grasp controller and Action Server for the REEM robot hand

This node provides an all-in-one posture controller for the REEM hand, and can be used directly as an Action Server for the hand, whilst also being compatible with the ROS Manipulation Pipeline.

Works with both simulated or real robot. In simulation, the controller moves all 3 joints of each finger with some delay, to mimic the behaviour of the underactuated joints on the real robot. 

There are 3 modes of operation: pre-grasp, grasp and release.
Position control is used, but the grasp can optionally use velocity feedback.

This node mimics the interface of pr2_gripper_grasp_controller.
